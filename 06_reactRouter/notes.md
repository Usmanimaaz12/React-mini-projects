#### NOTES
- React-router-DOM is not essential part of React. 
- It is a third party library.
- We get functionalities from installing react-router-dom. Example Link, NavLink, etc.
- NOTE: In React we do not use <a> tag. Instead use Link tag, because it will prevent the page from relaoding.

- useParams :- The useParams hook returns an object of key/value pairs of the dynamic params from the current URL that were matched by the <Route path>. Child routes inherit all params from their parent routes.

- Outlet, Layout
- Loader - optimization for api call before the mouseClick.
